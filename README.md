# Youtuber_Data_Analysis
Analysis on data of youtubers fetched with the help of Youtube API.

<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Practising on pre build dataset (csv,xlsx) set from kaggle is all fine but sometime we might have to work on real world data or raw data which we need to fetch with the help of an API(Application Programming Interface).
In this personal project of mine i have used Youtube's own api to fetch the data of some big youtubers i am sure you all know.
Then i have performed some analysis on those data

##--------------IMPORTANT------------------##
Some data are wrong but it due to youtube as they have changed their policy a lot and we get some outdated as well as wrong data.
